# GitNote WIP

*Supported Android versions: 12 to 14*

Android note which integrate Git. You can use this app with other desktop editors.

## Why

Because all apps which integrate git on Android either separate the note title from the name of the file or use old UI/UX frameworks

# Install

You can either download from the release page, or use [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium), to get updates easily.

# Build

[See](./BUILD.md).

# Current limitation

- Android does not differentiate case for file name, so if you have a folder named `A` and another folder named `a`, `a` will not be displayed.
- Rotation change will break ssl state. Workaround: restart the app
- Conflict will make the app crash
